# sorting-visualizer
Sorting visualizer is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work by presenting them with an interactive graphical display of 
the sorting process. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the primary languages used to create this tool.

HTML provides the structure and content for the visualizer, defining the layout and the different elements on the page. CSS is used to style the visualizer, 
controlling the colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the display. JavaScript is used to create the interactive functionality of the visualizer, allowing users to choose which sorting algorithm to visualize, adjust the speed of the animation, and pause, play, or reset the sorting process.

The sorting visualizer allows users to gain a better understanding of how different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quicksort, and merge sort work by providing a real-time visualization of the sorting process. As the algorithm sorts the elements, the visualizer displays the progress and movements of each element, providing a clear and intuitive representation of how the algorithm is working.

By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the sorting visualizer provides an easy-to-use tool for students, developers, and computer science enthusiasts to learn about sorting algorithms and visualize how they work in real-time.
